# lambra

Lambra is an experiment to implement Clojure on the
[Rubinius](http://rubini.us) Virtual Machine.

Early, absolutely unusable work in progress: DRAGONS AHEAD! But you can check
the code or play with it if you want :)

The structure for this first version is taken from Brian Ford's
[Poetics](http://github.com/brixen/poetics).
